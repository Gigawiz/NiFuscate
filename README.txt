NiFuscate was created to resolve a need for JavaScript Obfuscation, However, like everything we create, we took it a step farther.

NiFuscate takes in the file you wish to encrypt (at this point, js only), uploads it to our server, encrypts it using our powerfull api, then returns the file to you in the save location you specified. After 1 hour, your files are deleted from the server (to save disk space and to protect private code).

NiFuscate currently handles JavaScript only, with plans to include normal files, executable files (.net based), html, php and many more languages.

As with all our programs, NiFuscate is open source, released under the Creative Commons Attrubition-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License, which means it's free to use or modify as long as you keep us in your credits.

So enjoy the program!

Please Note: If we find the service being abused, we will be closing the source and requiring a registration with verification. The program will always remain free.
